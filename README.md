# credit-card-fraud-detection
Detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning in Python.
In this project, I built a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world anonymized data. I used a Random Forest Classifier, handled imbalanced data, and evaluated the results with a confusion matrix and classification report.

Key skills applied:

Data preprocessing with Pandas & Scikit-learn

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Model building and evaluation with RandomForestClassifier

Data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
